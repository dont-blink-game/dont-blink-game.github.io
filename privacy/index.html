        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          DON'T BLINK is an Android game developed by Studio Scale. This privacy
          policy explains how the app uses your device camera for blink
          detection and what information the app does (and does not) collect.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Camera access and use</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Why we request camera permission:</strong> to detect
            blinking so the blinking version of the game can function.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Required for gameplay:</strong> the blinking version
            requires camera access to play (and is highly recommended).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local processing:</strong> blink detection is processed
            on-device in the app using Google ML Kit (on-device models).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No video upload:</strong> we do not transmit your camera
            stream or frames to our servers for storage or analysis.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Android controls camera permission. You can deny or revoke camera
          access at any time in your device settings. If you do, the blinking
          version will not work.
        </p>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Information stored on your device</h2>
        <p>
          The app may store game progress and settings locally on your device
          (in app storage). This information is used to make the game work as
          expected and is not sent to Studio Scale.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Data we do not collect (currently)</h2>
        <p>
          We do not currently collect analytics, create user accounts, or
          require you to provide personal information (such as name, email, or
          phone number) to use the game.
        </p>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          The app uses Google ML Kit for on-device blink detection. We do not
          send your camera stream to Google for processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you download the app via Google Play, Google may collect and
          process information as part of providing the store and distribution
          services, in accordance with Google’s policies.

          DON'T BLINK is intended for users aged 13+. We do not knowingly
          collect personal information from children under 13.

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy as the game evolves (for example, if we add
          analytics or online features). When we do, we will update the “Last
          updated” date at the top of this page.
