        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          DON'T BLINK is a browser game hosted at
          <a href="https://dont-blink-game.github.io/"
            >dont-blink-game.github.io</a
          >. The blinking version of the game uses your device camera to detect
          blinking. Camera processing happens locally on your device; we do not
          upload your camera video.
        </p>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Camera access and use</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Why we request camera permission:</strong> to detect
            blinking so the blinking version of the game can function.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Required for gameplay:</strong> the blinking version
            requires camera access to play (and is highly recommended).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local processing:</strong> blink detection is processed
            on-device in your browser using Google ML Kit (or equivalent
            on-device models).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No video upload:</strong> we do not transmit your camera
            stream or frames to our servers for storage or analysis.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Your browser controls camera permission. You can deny or revoke camera
          access at any time in your browser settings. If you do, the blinking
          version may not work.
        </p>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Data we store on your device</h2>
        <p>
          We store a JSON save file in your browser (for example via local
          storage) to remember game state and settings. This data stays on your
          device unless you clear your browser storage.
        </p>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Data we do not collect (currently)</h2>
        <p>
          We do not currently collect analytics, create user accounts, or
          require you to provide personal information (such as name, email, or
          phone number) to use the game.
        </p>

      <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <p>
          The site is hosted using GitHub Pages. GitHub and other network
          providers may process basic request data (such as IP address) to
          deliver the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The game may load third-party libraries required for on-device blink
          detection (for example, Google ML Kit or model assets). When used,
          those libraries run locally in your browser for gameplay.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy as the game evolves (for example, if we add
          analytics or online features). When we do, we will update the “Last
          updated” date at the top of this page.
